        <p>Hello everyone Welcome to your fun website <br>
            Sometimes college is overwhelming. Your exams, essays, thesis, and due dates can turn into a <br>
             heavy workload weighing you down. In these moments, you might ask yourself why <br>
              you’re doing this to yourself, but don’t forget that you get to study a subject that <br>
               you’re passionate about. When you enrolled, <br>there was this hunger for learning 
                inside you and all you have to do is find that motivation again.
